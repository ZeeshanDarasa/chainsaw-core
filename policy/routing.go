package policy

// Wave-1 Agent B — ownership-routing policy rule kind.
//
// A routing rule is a Policy with Kind=KindRouting. It carries a
// RoutingRule body (path glob and/or package pattern, plus a notify
// channel) and runs in a separate evaluation pass from enforcement
// rules: routing matches NEVER block an install — they just resolve
// owners (today, exclusively via CODEOWNERS) and dispatch a webhook
// notification.
//
// This file is the matcher + dispatch glue. The hot-path enforcement
// pipeline (internal/server/server_repo_pipeline.go) calls
// EvaluateRouting after the enforcement decision has been made; routing
// fan-out is fire-and-forget and adds zero latency to the cache-hot
// path because the dispatcher is already async.
//
// SECURITY: routing pulls owners out of the parsed CODEOWNERS file —
// never from the request body. The webhook URL routing eventually
// uses comes from the per-team destination table (managed by
// internal/ownership), which is itself SSRF-validated on write. No
// user-supplied URL ever flows through this evaluator.
