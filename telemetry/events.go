// Package telemetry is the chainsaw event emission layer shared across CLI,
// MCP server, chainproxy, and backend API.
//
// The canonical event list is defined in events.yaml (same directory) and
// mirrored to Go constants here and to TS constants in
// ui_new/src/lib/events.generated.ts. If you add an event you must add it
// to ALL three places — the CI lint at scripts/lint-events.go blocks PRs
// that skip the registry.
//
// Common properties (required on every event; enforced by Validate):
// event_version, source, surface, channel, install_id, user_id (nullable),
// org_id (nullable), session_id, chainsaw_version, plan, persona, env.
